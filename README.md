### Hi there 👋 I'm Search Engineer 

* Highly qualified Search Engineer with 8+ years of experience in creating, supporting, troubleshooting, enhancing several search solutions based on Solr/Lucene/Elastic stacks in different areas like e-commerce, patents, publishing, finance. Deep understanding of the following frameworks internals. Ability to write and create custom Collectors/Scorers/Filters/Analyzers/Tokenizers/Queries

* Able to tune relevancy either by implementing different cutting edge similarities or by optimizing existing model with proved success in this area

* Deeply fascinated by DataScience and ML, combining classical information retrieval with advanced NLP/NLU techniques

* Passionate opensource community supporter (Maven, OpenJDK, Play Framework, Apache Solr, Indigo, Parso etc)

- 🥽 Collaborating with scientific lab on creating VR based experiment
- 🔭 Working on implementing similarity for molecules in Elasticsearch
- 🤓 Interested in ways of converting chem names to structure and back
- 🔬 Researching different ways to fingerprint users based on browser available data
- 🌱 Learning different implementations of object detection - Yolo, SSD, etc
- 🧪 Testing different ways to invoke Native code from Java (JNI, JNA, JNR, Panama)
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on any Information Retrieval related projects, just message me anytime about it
